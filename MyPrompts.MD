Explain to me, as if I was a student, what a stanza is

Sure thing! Think of a stanza as a building block of a poem. When you look at a poem, you'll often see it divided into smaller sections, kind of like paragraphs in prose writing. Each of these sections is a stanza.

Stanzas group together lines of poetry that share a similar theme, idea, or structure. They're like little poetic containers, holding together a set of lines that belong together. Stanzas can vary in length, from just a couple of lines to many lines, depending on the poem's structure and style.

Imagine you're building a Lego house. Each stanza is like a different room in that house. You might have a stanza that talks about nature, another one about love, and yet another about sadness. Each stanza helps organize the poem and gives it a rhythm and flow.
